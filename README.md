### Project #2 for CS61A - Fall 2020

In this project, I wrote a program that measures typing speed, with multiplayers feature and leaderboard. 

I also implemented typing autocorrect, which is a feature that attempts to correct the spelling of a word after a user types it. 

This project was the second project for CS61A, a course in Python. For more detailed project instructions visit https://cs61a.org/proj/cats/
